## Jets Project

* Skill Distillery Week 2 Homework

### Description

This project simulates managing an airfield. A user is prompted a list of
choices via a menu and can choose certain actions.

The choices the user can initiate are as follows:

* 2. Fly all jets - call the fly() method of all jets in the airfield array
* 3. View fastest jet - search for fastest jet in the array
* 4. View jet with the longest range - search for jet with longest range in the array
* 5. Load all Cargo Jets - call loadCargo() method for all cargo planes in the array
* 6. Dogfight! - call fight() for all fighter jets in the array
* 7. Add a jet to Fleet - add a custom jet to the array
* 8. Quit - exit program

This project was assigned after Week 2 of Skill Distillery's Java Coding
